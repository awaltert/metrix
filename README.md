# metrix
Metrics for monitoring applications

The goal of this crate is to provide metrics for application monitoring in a hierarchical way.
It will basically just wrap existing metrics crates.

This crate is in a very **early** stage and currently I'm still figuring out the API.
Also this crate is far from being feature complete.
