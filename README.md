Metrics for monitoring applications

## Goal

Applications/services can have a lot of metrics and one of the greatest challenges is 
organizing them. This is what `metrix` tries to help with.

Metrix does not aim for providing exact numbers for scientific or financial analysis.

This crate is in a very **early** stage and the API might still change. There may be
backends provided for monitoring solutions but currently only a snapshot that can be 
serialized to JSON is provided.

## Contributing

Contributing is welcome. Even if done by constructive criticism.

## License

Metrix is primarily distributed under the terms of
both the MIT license and the Apache License (Version 2.0).
